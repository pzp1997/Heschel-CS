3. Follow the directions on this page to setup Git:
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#set-up-git

4. Now go to this link to make a GitHub account:
https://github.com/join

5. Email me your username so that I can add you as a "Contributor", allowing you to make edits to the code

6. Now you can go to this link and start exploring:
https://github.com/pzp1997/Heschel-CS

7. Download the GitHub for Mac application from this link:
http://mac.github.com

8. Click on this link to copy the GitHub repo to your computer (save it in the default location):
github-mac://openRepo/https://github.com/pzp1997/Heschel-CS

9. Open up Finder and from the menu bar go to Go > Go to Folder and type in ~/ in the box that comes up

10. From here, find the folder Heschel-CS and do one of the following two options
	Option 1: Drag the folder into your Sidebar
	Option 2: Right-click on the folder and click on Make Alias. You can now move the folder Heschel-CS alias where ever you would like (I recommend the Desktop)



Using Git and GitHub Effectively (MAKE SURE YOU DO THESE STEPS EVERYTIME YOU WORK ON THE PROJECT!):
1. Open the GitHub app and click on the Sync Branch button in the top-right corner. This will add all the changes since you last worked on the project into the files in the folder Heschel-CS.
2. Open the folder Heschel-CS (or Heschel-CS alias, if you went with Option 2)
3. You can open up any of the files in that folder to edit/view them in IDLE, or you can add a new file just by moving it into the Heschel-CS folder
4. Now that you are done making your changes, save the file and open the GitHub app again
5. Click on the Changes button on the left side of the app
6. On that page, click Commit and then click on the Sync Branch button in the top-right corner
