Heschel-CS
==========
Welcome to our project!

We are students at the Abraham Joshua Heschel School who are interested in programming. The purpose of this project is to allow us to collaborate in the creation of a Python project (exactly what that project is, has not yet been determined). The goals of the project are as follows:

  1. Create something in Python
  2. Learn to collaboratively code/work in a programming team using Git/GitHub
  3. Learn new coding techniques from eachother by observing how someone solves a specific task
  4. Learn how to debug someone else's code and making your code debuggable by somebody else
  5. Have fun writing code and expanding our knowledge of Python

Additionally, we think it would be a cool idea if some of our members could upload some interesting programs they made, as reference (or just for fun). As this project will ideally take in members of all knowledge levels (as long as they are motivated), it would also be helpful for more experienced users to upload some "tutorials" -- a short programs that can teach a fundemental Python skill (it would be great if these tutorials had a good amount of comments to make them easy to understand and learn from).

For now, we are just in the recrutiing stage. After we amass enough people, we will meet during one lunch period(?) and decide on a project to work on, as well as begin to divy up the different tasks. After this, all work on the project will be done on one's own free time, and you will be able to contribute as much (or as little) as you wish. We really hope to have a fully functioning program by the end of this school year.

If you would like to get involved, email me (palmerpa@heschel.org) or just talk to me in school.

Stay tuned for further updates!
