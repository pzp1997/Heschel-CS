Double Pendulum

Here are some links to youtube videos of a double pendulum simulator, which is one possible option for our project:

Car/Helicopter

We can create a simple "racing" game. The car would be controlled by arrow keys, and checkpoints would be randomly generated.
We can have the helicopter fly around in the 3D environment.
Eventually, we *might* be able to hook up an accelerometor with an Arduino and use the input from the accelerometer as the controls (instead of the arrow keys).
